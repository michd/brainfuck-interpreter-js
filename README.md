# JavaScript Brainfuck interpreter #

As the title implies, this is a [Brainfuck](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter written in JavaScript. 

Currently it simply runs your code without further ado. There is basic support for input through an onkeydown event.

## Usage ##

Enter your Brainfuck code in the Brainfuck input field

If you want to do a plain execution, click 'Run'

If you want to debug and step through, click 'Step'

If you want to slowly automatically step through, click 'Step auto:' after entering how many miliseconds you want the debugger to wait between steps.

You can stop auto-stepping by clicking 'Stop'

Re-initialize the program by clicking 'Initialize'
